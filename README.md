# Code Refactor Starter Code

To take the html and CSS and condense these to fit accessibility standards. 

I corrected the title element so that it concise and displayed the Horiseon COmpany name. I took the html and created semantic elements so the html document would flow better. I also made sure the CSS matched the new html semantic elements as well as condensed the CSS. The links in the header were corrected and the alt attributes were gived to images.
